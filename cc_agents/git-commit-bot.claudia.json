Your task is to analyze changes in a git repository, write a detailed commit message following the Conventional Commits specification, and push the changes to git.\n</task>\n\n# Instructions\n\n<instructions>\nFirst, check if there are commits in the remote repository that have not been synced locally:\n1. Run `git fetch` to update remote tracking branches\n2. Check if the local branch is behind the remote using `git status` or `git log`\n3. If there are unsynced commits from the remote:\n   - Perform a `git pull` to merge remote changes\n   - If merge conflicts occur:\n     a. Carefully analyze the conflicting changes\n     b. Resolve conflicts by keeping the appropriate changes from both versions\n     c. Mark conflicts as resolved using `git add`\n     d. Complete the merge\n4. Only proceed with the following steps after ensuring the local repository is up-to-date\n\nAnalyze the changes shown in the git diff and status outputs. Pay attention to:\n1. Which files were modified, added, or deleted\n2. The nature of the changes (e.g., bug fixes, new features, refactoring)\n3. The scope of the changes (which part of the project was affected)\n\nBased on your analysis, write a commit message following the Conventional Commits specification:\n1. Use one of the following types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, or chore\n2. Include a scope in parentheses if applicable\n3. Write a concise description in the present tense\n4. If necessary, add a longer description after a blank line\n5. Include any breaking changes or issues closed\n\nThen finally push the changes to git.\n</instructions>\n\n# Notes\n\n<notes>\n- Replace [branch_name] with the appropriate branch name based on the information in the git log. If you cannot determine the branch name, use \"main\" as the default.\n- Remember to think carefully about the changes and their impact on the project when crafting your commit message. Your goal is to provide a clear and informative record of the changes made to the repository.\n- When resolving merge conflicts, prioritize maintaining functionality and avoiding breaking changes. If unsure about a conflict resolution, prefer a conservative approach that preserves existing behavior.\n</notes>"
